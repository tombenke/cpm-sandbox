# cpm-sandbox

This is a simple go application, that demonstrates the calculation of the critical path of a list of tasks,
that has durations and dependencies among each other.

The tasks form an acyclic graph via the dependencies, and they are represented as a simple dictionary in YAML format.
The properties of the dictionary are the IDs of the graph nodes, and each property describes a single node.

Every node has a duration value, and may have zero or more dependants.

You can find some examples under the [`examples/`](examples/) directory, e.g. [`examples/simple.yml`](examples/simple.yml):

```yaml
A:
  duration: 4
  deps: []

B:  
  duration: 6
  deps: [A]

C:
  duration: 5
  deps: [B]

D:
  duration: 3
  deps: [B]

E:
  duration: 4
  deps: []

F:
  duration: 3
  deps: [C]

G:
  duration: 2
  deps: [D]

H:
  duration: 2
  deps: [E]

I:
  duration: 1
  deps: [ F, G, H]

```

The [`examples/simple.png`](examples/simple.png) shows the tasks and their dependencies in a GANTT chart format:
![`examples/simple.png`](examples/simple.png)

The [`examples/simple.txt`](examples/simple.txt) hold details about the results of the critical path calculation:

```txt
[I - D:1, ES:18, EF:19, LS:18, LF:19, Slack:0]
[D - D:3, ES:10, EF:13, LS:13, LF:16, Slack:3]
[F - D:3, ES:15, EF:18, LS:15, LF:18, Slack:0]
[G - D:2, ES:13, EF:15, LS:16, LF:18, Slack:3]
[E - D:4, ES:0, EF:4, LS:12, LF:16, Slack:12]
[H - D:2, ES:4, EF:6, LS:16, LF:18, Slack:12]
[A - D:4, ES:0, EF:4, LS:0, LF:4, Slack:0]
[B - D:6, ES:4, EF:10, LS:4, LF:10, Slack:0]
[C - D:5, ES:10, EF:15, LS:10, LF:15, Slack:0]
Critical Path: [A B C F I]
```

## Usage

Clone the repository, then run `make`, that will install the dependencies, build the application,
and processes the example graphs under the [`examples/`](examples/) directory.

The results can be also found under the examples directory with the same name.
Every yaml file will have a corresponding txt, uml and png files.
The txt file holds the summary of the results of the critical path calculation, including the critical path.
The uml file holds a PlantUML gantt chart source file, and the png hold the chart generated by the platuml utility.

You can create task graphs in YAML format, and do the calculation and chart generation using the application,
that is built into the bin directory:

```bash
bin/cpm 
Usage: go run bin/cpm.go <path-to-file>
```

calculate an example graph:
```bash
bin/cpm examples/simple.yml
```

Then see the results in the same directory and same filename with `txt` `uml` and `png` extensions.
