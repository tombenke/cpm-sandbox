# cpm-sandbox

This is a simple go application, that demonstrates the calculation of the critical path of a list of tasks,
that has durations and dependencies among each other.

The tasks form an acyclic graph via the dependencies, and they are represented as a simple dictionary in YAML format.
The properties of the dictionary are the IDs of the graph nodes, and each property describes a single node.

Every node has a duration value, and may have zero or more dependants.

You can find some examples under the [`examples/`](examples/) directory, e.g. [`examples/simple.yml`](examples/simple.yml):

```yaml
A:
  duration: 4
  deps: []

B:  
  duration: 6
  deps: [A]

C:
  duration: 5
  deps: [B]

D:
  duration: 3
  deps: [B]

E:
  duration: 4
  deps: []

F:
  duration: 3
  deps: [C]

G:
  duration: 2
  deps: [D]

H:
  duration: 2
  deps: [E]

I:
  duration: 1
  deps: [ F, G, H]

```

## Usage

Clone the repository, then run `make`, that will install the dependencies, build the application, and processes the example graphs under the [`examples/`](examples/) directory.

The results can be also found under the examples directory with the same name. Every yaml file will have a corresponding txt, uml and png files. The txt file holds the summary of the results of the critical path calculation, including the critical path. The uml file holds a PlantUML gantt chart source file, and the png hold the chart generated by the platuml utility.
